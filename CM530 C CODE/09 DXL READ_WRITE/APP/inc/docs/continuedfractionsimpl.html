streams</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	One approach to exact real
arithmetic is using <I>streams</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
as a data structure to represent numbers. Even if a machine has
finite resources and cannot store an infinite sequences, such
infinite streams can represent programs that successively generate
the elements of the sequence. The stream computed on demand are often
referred to as </SPAN><I>computable streams</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">.
Some possible representations are </SPAN><I>continued fractions</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">,
</SPAN><I>B-adic number streams,</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
</SPAN><I>linear fractional transformations</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
and </SPAN><I>continued logarithms</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
(a mutation of continued fractions that instead of the integer
partial quotients uses only </SPAN><I>0</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">'s
and </SPAN><I>1</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">'s).</SPAN></P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; font-style: normal">	A
continued fraction is actually a stream of numbers. The arithmetic
with continued fractions is harder than the arithmetic on numbers in
positional notations, but some advantages arise immediately. First of
all, some irrational numbers can be represented exactly as little
programs to provide the partial quotients on demand. Another
advantage is the possibility to cascade several routines and produce
an output stream of partial quotients at a low cost. The user doesn't
have to decide in advance how much precision it necessary, preventing
wasting time and effort on more precision than it is actually
required.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">	Currently,
we support only simple continued fractions, (</SPAN><I>simple</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
because all the numerators are one) but expecting to add nonregular
continued fraction support in future versions of the project. We do
</SPAN>not actually use <I>java.io.Stream</I> to represent a
continued fraction, as one might expect. Instead, we derive our
numbers from <I>java.util.Iterator, </I>usually <SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">iterating
over the partial quotients of continued fraction expansions</SPAN>.</P>
<P ALIGN=LEFT STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">	The <I>ContinuedFraction</I>
represents a simple continued fraction that can be reused and
supports the elementary arithmetic operations. The abstract class
<I>PartialQuotients</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"> interface
represents a (potentially infinite) stream of partial quotients.
While a <I>PartialQuotients</I> instance is consumable, a
</SPAN><I>ContinuedFraction</I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">
knows to generate its partial quotients as many times as required.
<I>ContinuedFraction </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">will
probably be refactored to </SPAN>implement <I>Number </I><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal">in
future versions.</SPAN></SPAN></P>
